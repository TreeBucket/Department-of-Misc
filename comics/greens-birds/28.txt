Miners must really freak out other birds.
They're never a bother to humans, but they have an unfair reputation as pests because- as noted in GB16- they have a lot in common with the unrelated Indian Mynah species.
Miners, btw, are an offshoot of the incredibly successful honeyeater family. They've got the "noisy sociable speckled omnivore" thing sorted. If you have some spare time, grab the wikipedia article for noisy miners; their social structure is incredibly complicated and delightfully weird.
