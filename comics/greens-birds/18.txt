This one photo is really... educational? So the honeyeater is perching on a eucalyptus branch to drink some nectar from the tree's flowers. There are dozens of species of honeyeater here and they mostly live off nectar. They're like hummingbirds, but much bigger and much angrier. They're really successful because, well, we missed out on the last lot of glaciers...
The continent is old, and was too flat & equatorial to get ripped up by the previous era of glaciation. So a lot of our soil is terrible. By European standards, the soil in my ironbark forest would probably be classified as gravel. On top of that, the weather is really unpredictable. But generally dry. As a result... see the leaves in this photo? They're thin, poisonous, and have a reflective waxy layer to deal with excess sunlight. Our inland plants are optimised around retaining water, with gathering sunlight a distant second priority. These plants are never short on energy, though, and so have wound up producing huge amounts of nectar to attract pollinating birds and mammals (who will also hopefully have a shot at any pesky bugs in the vicinity.) Nectar is practically the base of the food chain here. This is why there are so many species of honeyeater, and why the more shouty ones have prospered with the arrival of humans- who, for some reason, seem to enjoy surrounding their houses with a lot flowering plants...
Meanwhile, a few of the people I've taken to see the ironbark forest have remarked that it feels creepy, or haunted, or even has serial killer vibes. Ouch. But it's an environment where small plants grow in the shade of the bigger plants, because too much sunlight would kill them. Like it's the opposite of how our instincts say a forest should work. It's a genuinely weird place.
