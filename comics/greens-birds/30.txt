I used to have a birdbath. Now instead I have a large dish filled with half-digested berries. And a metre-long stretch of verandah stained purple by yet more half-digested berries. Currawongs are seriously beautiful animals, but have terrible manners.
Like their cousins the magpies (GB5), currawongs are intelligent, sociable, fearless, omnivorous, beautiful, musical and thoroughly at home in the suburbs. They are only very distantly related to corvids (GB20) but have wound up occupying a very corvid-ish ecological role.
Their eye colour is my favourite colour in the whole world.
