A lot of the ecological niches occupied by mammals on more sensible continents are, in Australia, occupied by birds . I guess the mobility is a plus in a continent with such unpredictable weather? Another side of this, which comes as a real surprise to science nerd Australians travelling overseas, is to discover that our birds are SMALL. Our ravens, [black] swans and parrots are 2/3 to 1/2 the size of those elsewhere. Emus are big, but not as big as ostriches!
Blame the nutrient-poor soil, I guess.
