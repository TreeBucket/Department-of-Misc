The ibis is commonly known as the bin chicken, because they've adapted beautifully to city life by eating the most vile garbage imaginable. They've wound up being kind of the spirit animal or mascot of young people from cities, owing to their cheerful adaptability in an uncaring urban landscape and a certain elegance. (Threskiornis means "worshipped bird" if you want a measure how far the ibis' stock has fallen over the centuries.)
